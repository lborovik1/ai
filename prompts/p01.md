========================================================================
I want to make a Demo of RAG (retrieval augmented generation).
Please review directories demo_RAG and fasthtml and suggest if there is 
a simple example that I can use with minimum effort.

Please review this file /Users/lada/Documents/GitHub/ai/fasthtml/test04_chat_rag_milvus.py and suggest changes that I can use for the RAG (retrieval augmented generation)
the Web Demo 2.
